# K-Nearest Neighbors Optimization Using Ball Tree

## üìã Problem Statement

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is fundamental in Machine Learning for classification and regression tasks. However, the traditional brute-force approach has a critical limitation:

**Problem**: For each query point, we must compute the distance to **every point** in the dataset to find the K nearest neighbors. This results in **O(N) time complexity** per query, where N is the number of points.

**Impact**: 
- For a dataset with 10,000 points, each query requires 10,000 distance computations
- This becomes impractical for large datasets or real-time applications
- Scales poorly as dataset size increases

## üéØ Our Solution

We implement a **Ball Tree** data structure that reduces the query complexity from **O(N) to O(log N)** on average.

### How Ball Tree Works

The Ball Tree is a hierarchical space-partitioning data structure that:

1. **Organizes points into nested hyperspheres (balls)**: Each node in the tree represents a ball that bounds a subset of points
2. **Uses triangle inequality for pruning**: If a ball is too far from the query point, we can skip checking all points inside it
3. **Achieves logarithmic search time**: By eliminating large portions of the search space, we only need to check a small fraction of points

### Triangle Inequality Pruning

The key optimization comes from the triangle inequality:
```
For query point q, ball center c, and radius r:
If distance(q, c) - r ‚â• distance to k-th neighbor:
    ‚Üí Skip entire ball (all points inside)
```

This mathematical property allows us to **eliminate 85-95% of distance computations**.

## üìä Data Structures Used

This project demonstrates the use of **3 key data structures** to achieve optimal performance:

### 1. **Vector (std::vector)** - Dynamic Array
- **Purpose**: Store point coordinates and collections of points
- **Why**: Provides dynamic sizing and efficient random access O(1)
- **Usage**: 
  - Storing D-dimensional coordinates in each Point
  - Managing collections of points during tree construction
  - Storing leaf node points

### 2. **Binary Tree (using std::unique_ptr)** - Hierarchical Structure
- **Purpose**: Ball Tree implementation with parent-child relationships
- **Why**: Enables hierarchical space partitioning and O(log N) search
- **Usage**:
  - Each node represents a bounding hypersphere
  - Left and right children partition the space
  - Recursive structure allows efficient pruning

### 3. **Priority Queue (std::priority_queue)** - Max Heap
- **Purpose**: Maintain K nearest neighbors during search
- **Why**: Efficiently tracks top K elements with O(log K) insertion
- **Usage**:
  - Stores current K best neighbors
  - Automatically maintains sorted order
  - Enables quick comparison with new candidates

## üî¨ How It Works

### Ball Tree Construction

1. **Compute Centroid**: Find the center point of all points
2. **Calculate Radius**: Find the farthest point from center
3. **Select Pivots**: Choose two far-apart points for partitioning
4. **Partition**: Split points based on which pivot they're closer to
5. **Recurse**: Repeat for left and right subsets
6. **Stop**: When subset has ‚â§ 40 points, make it a leaf

### KNN Search Process

1. **Start at Root**: Begin with the entire dataset
2. **Check Distance**: Calculate distance from query to ball center
3. **Prune Decision**: 
   - If ball is too far ‚Üí Skip it entirely (Triangle Inequality!)
   - If ball might contain neighbors ‚Üí Explore it
4. **Visit Closer Child First**: Prioritize promising subtrees
5. **Check Leaf Points**: When reaching a leaf, check all points inside
6. **Maintain Top K**: Use priority queue to track best K neighbors

### Why It's Fast

**Triangle Inequality Pruning**:
```
If distance(query, ball_center) - ball_radius > k-th_neighbor_distance:
    Skip entire ball (could have 1000s of points!)
```

This single check can eliminate checking thousands of points!
